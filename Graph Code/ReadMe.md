## **Abstract**  
Cybersecurity threats have significantly evolved with the advancement of digital networks and emerging technologies. This paper explores various attack methodologies, including zero-day vulnerabilities, insider threats, and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. It further examines how modern defense mechanisms, such as machine learning-driven intrusion detection systems and blockchain-based security solutions, can mitigate these threats. Through a comparative analysis of existing frameworks, the paper identifies key research gaps and proposes a comprehensive security strategy for robust network protection.
